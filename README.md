# spark-socket-client-or-server
Attempt to test using the spark core or photon as a client or server for fast communication to light D7 LED



April 14. Lots of links to what other people have tried. The two basic issues are:

Spark core as a server and use a regular websocket to connect

or

Spark core as a client and use a node server with webbrowser interface (like a chat server) to connect

All I wish to do is send two strings to the spark core or photon


D7-ON


and


D7-OFF


Note: I do not wish to have any debug information in the code as the D7 LED is proof that it is working.
